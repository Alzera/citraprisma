The connection between KALSI Part 8 boards is applied with an open connection system or closed connection using KALSI Kompon IN-F and KALSI Tape FG-50. KALSIPart 8 was applied to the KALSIFrame MT-51 and KALSIFrame MS-51 steel frames which were installed according to KALSI recommendations to obtain a complete partition system that has good durability. The KALSIPart 8 partition system is a partition system that has high quality and is sturdy because it has passed international standard laboratory tests for acoustic performance, mechanical strength, and fire resistance. KALSI Part 8 is also available in 2 and 4 recess corner variants (KALSI Part 8-R2 & KALSI Part 8 â€“ R4). Make sure you get a genuine KALSI Part 8 product by checking the KALSI Part 8 printing label on each side."

      "content": "KALSIClad is a board suitable for use as an exterior wall. KALSIClad should be mounted on a suitable steel frame (our recommended design, dimensions, thickness and spacing). Parameters such as wind load, dead load, building height and seismic risk level need to be carefully calculated. When installing exterior siding, joints can be left open (visible joints) or closed (flush joints) using a special sealant to resist weather changes and moisture movement. We recommend using polyurethane sealants with UV protection and paintable sealants."

KALSIFloor 20 is applied by installing KALSIScrew FL screws on a steel frame (design adjusted to live load and other parameters), KALSIFloor 20 can be used for mezzanines, additional rooms and others with faster construction preparation.",
      "content2": "The advantage is that the structural load is lighter, the installation system is easy, clean, flexible and earthquake resistant. If used for floors with heavy loads, KALSIFloor 20 must be coated with cement mortar and chicken wire before covering with ceramic, vinyl floor carpet, parquet to prevent friction and impact. Consult your project with Kalsi's team of experts."
