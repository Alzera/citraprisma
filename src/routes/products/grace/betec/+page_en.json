  "content": "GCP’s Betec® M-5, a special blend of cement, quartz sand and active chemicals in powder form, turns concrete into a water-resistant barrier. Water, as a component in concrete, is naturally present in its pores and form a connective network of capillary voids. In addition, water can enter the concrete surface through pores and cracks. Instead of fighting against this water, the active chemicals in Betec M-5 work with it to trigger a chemical reaction which results in the formation of insoluble crystals. The crystals block off the water channels, thereby delivering in-depth and permanent protection against water penetration.",
